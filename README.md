# VU-honours
This repo will contain the coding projects I created for my research project.
The research project is part of my honours program at the VU.

## custom_ls
The custom_ls project is a simplified implementation of ls.
The only allowed option is `-l`, and `-d` is used to specify the target directory.

## performance_measurement
The performance_measurement tests how long it takes to write a 1 GB file.
